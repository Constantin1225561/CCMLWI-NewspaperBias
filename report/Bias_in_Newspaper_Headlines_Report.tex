\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
TODO
%The abstract should be no more than 150 words.
%It is a short summary of the paper. If you had to
%re-state what your paper says in 150 words or less, what would you
%say? By the way, I recommend writing the abstract LAST, since it is
 %    easier this way.
%      For a conference paper, most people will read the abstract to see
 %     if they find it interesting enough to read the whole paper. This
  %    makes a lot of sense if you go to a conference in a topic that
  %    interests you, but find that there are 100+ other papers.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
 
TODO
%     The introduction should get the reader interested, explain your
 %    motivations, and provide a quick guide to the rest of the paper.
     
 %     Why is your topic important? Convince us!
 %     Where is it used? What are the applications.
  %    What will you talk about, and what did you do?

  %   Include an overview of the rest of your paper (e.g., section 2
     %       covers...section 3 presents...).
            
            
\section{Background}
 
TODO
% Include any relevant and specific info,
 %e.g. hardware statistics, equipment used.
% There is {\bf always} some background to cover.
%            
%           Describe what other people had to say on this topic(s)
%            (be sure to cite your references, and quote as appropriate).
%           Describe what other people did on this topic (or related topics).
%           In the references section, cite the papers/books that you used.
%Talk about problems and shortcomings of their work.
%Talk about how your work is different and better.
%
%Here are some citation examples. 
%This is a book about VLSI \cite{Weste93}.
%Also, the references contain a good conference paper \cite{LiY88},
%and a good journal article \cite{BiS92}.
%Anything you found useful.
%Include textbooks from class if you want.


\section{Project}

TODO
%It is always a good idea to have text between a section header and
%a subheading.

\subsection{Design}
TODO
%Describe your approach to the problem.
%Describe what you did.
%            What you already had (and where it came from).
%            What you added/changed.
%            For parts, include close-up drawings (e.g. Magic screenshots).
\subsection{Evaluation}
TODO
 %         What did/didn't work?
 %         Include graphs, equations, pictures, etc. as appropriate


{\bf Each team member must submit an individual report.}

%See the ``paper summary feedback'' on the class website for
%useful examples of what to do when writing a technical document.

%\hrule

%Remember your audience - your paper should be understandable by any CS
%student (at your level) who has taken this class.

%Things to include in the report:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Do not use bullet points unless absolutely necessary!
%    \item Pictures
%    \item Your observations and measurements
 %   \item  Equations
%    \item Graphs
 %   \item Figures
 %   \item Simulation, model 
%\end{itemize}

%Note: If you use color graphs, make sure you use a color printer when
%printing the report! I have seen several reports that say things like
%``the blue dots represent ..., while the red ones represent...'', only to
%have the figure printed in grey-scale.

%\subsection{ACM style}
%So here is my
%incomplete ``online first'' citation in ACM style:

%Note: You can use [1] instead of [Lyons97], if you prefer.

\section{Results}
TODO
%            Include relevant observations, measurements, and statistics.
%            For example, for the VLSI Class: Include statistics such as
%            timing information if available by simulation, or if not,
 %           your own analysis about critical path, delays, and clock
%            cycles. Be sure to include size information: the total size
 %           of the circuit measured (X lambda by Y lambda), and the
 %           transistor count. 
            
\section{Summary}
TODO
%           Try to draw together the intro, background, and project
 %           sections.
 %          How do they all relate together? (They may appear to be
 %           disjoint sections to an unfamiliar reader).
 %          Restate important results.
\section{Conclusions}
TODO
%           You can combine Summary and Conclusions as you see fit.
%           What was accomplished and learned.
 %          What you would have done differently.
 %          Future work.
           
%The references must be in the same 2-column format as the rest of your
%paper.

\section*{Appendix}
You are allowed to have appendices, as needed. Appendices are mainly for
code or mathematical derivations. You do not have to turn in all code
used in your experiment; use your best judgement. You may want to
include only relevant sections of code. Appendices do {\bf not} count in the
page count. For example, if you have 4 pages of report, you may also
turn in an appendix that is as long as you like. The appendix should be
separate, with your name(s) on it. The appendix does not have to be in two-column
format. 
%The appendix pages should be ordered, but do not have to be numbered.
